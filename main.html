    <h1>To my baby,</h1>
    <p class="letter">
      I can’t believe we’ve come this far, especially when I think back how it all started. Feeling ko ang tagal tagal na, pero feeling ko rin kahapon lang. I can still recall the first time I saw your profile (nung na-add ikaw sa gc)— something in my mind was telling me na “ito na ‘yon” HWHGSHWHSHA and even before thinking, I made the first move kaagad. Pero, kasing bilis din ng pag first move ko ang pag give up ko kasi ‘kala ko rin gusto ka ng friends ko, yk who. I didn’t want to step on anyone’s toes, but little did I know, tayo pala. That moment, ‘yong hesitation ko na ‘yon, parang wala na ngayon HAHAHAHHA. At the back of my mind, I’m so glad I took that leap, even if ‘di ako sigurado at first.

It’s funny how life works sometimes. After that moment of hesitation, I thought about giving up easily.  Pero deep inside, I knew na there was this something special about you na hindi ko talaga mabitawan. That feeling stayed with me, even when I tried to push it aside. And then came our first call. I can still recall the way I felt in that moment. I can feel the connection, kahit ako lang nagsasalita no’n 🙄. That was simething undeniable, something that made me realize na gusto pala talaga kita, baby. It was a mix of nerves, excitement, and overwhelming knowing na you’re someone worth getting to know deeply. That call was the turning point for me, the moment I realized na hindi siya basta basta crush or admiration lang, pero I can feel na it’s something stronger.

Tbh, I didn’t ask Qi to tell you about me. Namention ko lang talaga na gusto kita, and bigla lang siya nagsabi “ask ko kaya si Christa if gusto ka niya”. At first, I was very uncertain—what if there was no chance? what if masasaktan lang ako? what if mapapahiya lang ako? Pero, as I was thinking about it, I realized na if I won’t let her, I won’t know. I decided to take that leap, that risk. What if may chance pala? And if wala, at least I tried. I never could’ve imagined that you’d feel the same way, and now, looking back, I’m so thankful na pumayag ako na gawin niya ‘yon, and I’m so thankful na I did the first move. It was the best decision I’ve ever made, baby.

One of the moments I’ll never forget is ‘yong nag hugot ikaw after telling Qi you liked me HWNSHWJHS “nami mag leave sa gc ah, simo na lang ko” HWHHSHWHSHSHA. You showed a vulnerability that touched me deeply HENDHEHSHSH FR. I think that was when I realized how much I admired you—not just how you look, but for the depth of your amotions and willingness to share them with me. You’ve always been so open, and that’s something I truly love about you. Then after telling Qi you liked me, there was this time you told me you wanted to call me. You had no idea how much that meant to me. It was like a confirmation na this was real, and I felt like we were both ready to take things further. ‘Di ko rin makakalimutan ‘yong first time na tinawag mo ‘kong “baby” HENDHJWHA “baby, ay bel bella” HNWHSJWHSJSH. I’ll never forget how excited and happy I felt at those times.

Then this time came—you replied to my IG note on your IG note also, giving me a clue that you like me back. I can still feel the butterflies in my stomach thinking about it. It was in thise words that I knew for sure—you liked me back. It was such a very simole gesture, pero it spoke volumes. It felt like a quiet confession, and in the moment, I’ve realized that everything I’d been feeling was returned. It was a kind of relief I didn’t know I needed, and from then on, I’ve been more certain on us, than ever before.

You were also the first person I offered my favorite not-so-love-song, “Unless You Leave”. It’s not a typical love song, but for some reason, it reminds me of us. I love na it’s something we share, something that’s just ours.

In you, I’ve found the first person who made me truly understand what love is, no joke. I realized, baby, na it’s not about the grand gestures or fairy tale endings; it’s about being there for each other, supporting each other, and growing together. Something I’ve never felt before, and sayo ko lang pala mararamdaman hehe. You’ve shown me how to love in the healthiest, most genuine way, and that’s the gift I never thought I’d find. You also made me realize how important it it to be with someone who treats you with the respect you deserve, someone who sees you for who you are and will still choose you every. single. day. I’ve learned so much about love from you, and I’m very grateful for that.

With you, I feel like secured na ako. I don’t even have to worry about you doing anything behind my back, and first time ko ‘yan (kasi sa lahat ng naka ano k, kahit ang lalapit na, nakakaisip ak ng ganyn gehgjehsjehs). There’s this quiet confidence in me na when it comes to you, when it comes to us, I trust you completely. That kind of security is very rare for me to feel, and I’m so thankful for it. You’ve built that trust so nayurally, and it’s something that continues to grow every day. I hope you won’t break that trust, baby ☹️. I never realizef how much I needed this kind of certainty until I foun you ☹️☹️.

I absolutely love the way you talk to me, how you let your pababy side show hehe (HENDHWNHSJWHSJEHSJ), and the way you laugh. That’s just three of the infinite things I love about you. Everything about you just makes me wanna smile. You have this energy na I want to listen to all way, just soaking in the way you speak. There’s a comfort in your words, a lightness that makes everything feel okay hehe. Honestly, I can’t get enough of it, I’ll never get used to it, and I never want to.

Even though my parents are strict, I want you to know that I would risk everything for you. I love you so much, and I’m willing to face whatever obstacle comes to iur way hust to be with you. You are worth it, every single bit of it. I’ll always put you first because you’ve shown me what true love is. You’ve made me realize that sometimes, the best things in life are the ones worth fighting for, and I would fight for you each day.

Thank you, baby, for being you— masungit, pababy, corny, ay mali. Patient, kind, understanding, and so loving. Thank you for being the person I never knew I needed but now can’t imavine living without. That you for showing me what love should feel like. I’m so excited for the future, for the day we finally we meet in person,  but until then, I’ll chering every message, every voice message, every call, and every moment we have. Thank you for making me happy with your corny jokes, baby. 4’11 talaga kaligayahan ko HWNSHJWHSJWHSH.  You are my heart, and I love you more than words could ever express. Walang iwanan baby, okay? Forever na ‘to. I LOVE YOU SO SO SO MUCHHHH.

Happy valentine’s day, baby! ❤️
